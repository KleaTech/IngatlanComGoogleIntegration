# IngatlanComGoogleIntegration
Integrate Google Maps into Ingatlan.com. When you open a page with a real estate for sale, this script:
- instantly shows **travel time** and **distance** by car to the address from Budapest central (Corvin)
- highlights the route to the real estate on road
- allows you to see street view with one click in place
- allows you to make the map full screen with one click in place

Additionally:
- on the listings page when you hover over a listing, the map will show the location of that listing (so you will get a preview of where it is without opening it)
- shows when the listing was updated last

*NOTE:* You need to register to Google Maps Platform and use your own API key. Registration is free. The usage of the route planner API is NOT free, but every user gets a free $200 monthly quota. So any reasonable private use will be for free.
